# README

This project contains a working React/Redux/TypeScript frontend application. The application communicates with the backend Ruby on Rails 7 API running devise, devise-jwt, and rack-cors gems.

The React application will (hopefully) contain various tests for sanity checking the project, including unit and integration tests.
